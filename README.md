This is the software-part of a summer-project, a collaboration game involving wind, water and a little boat.

## The game
The objective of the game is to steer a little boat through a maze, using fans mounted around the maze. Each player can drive one side of the maze, thus getting the boat through the maze requires collaboration.

## Hardware
This software runs on a custom PIC18F4520-based board. It's basic function is to read four inputs (pushbuttons) and depending on those inputs to drive four groups of fans.
Additionally it has five LED-outputs, a joystick input (as an alternative for the four pushbuttons) and a serial port for debugging purposes.
